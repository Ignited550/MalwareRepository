# Potentionally Unwanted Programs
Due to the nature of PUPs, (**P**otentially **U**nwanted **P**rograms) very few will actualy be added. If they are an extra extreme variety of PUPs, sorta like Bonzi Buddy, they will probably be added.

If I happen to find one on the internet while doing testing or something, I'll probably add it.

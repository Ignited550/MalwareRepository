# Potentionally Unwanted Programs
Due to the nature of PUPs, (**P**otentially **U**nwanted **P**rograms) very few will actualy be added. If they are an extra extreme variety of PUPs, sorta like Bonzi Buddy, they will probably be added.

I am **not** going to add stuff like DriverEasy or CCleaner unless it also is spyware or something of the like.

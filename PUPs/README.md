# Potentionally Unwanted Programs
Due to the nature of PUPs, (**P**otentially **U**nwanted **P**rograms) very few will actualy be added. If they are an extra extreme variety of PUPs, sorta like Bonzi Buddy, they will probably be added.

If I happen to find one on the internet while doing testing or something, I'll probably add it.

1. [Bit Driver Updater](#Bit-Driver-Updater)
2. [Bonzi Buddy](#Bonzi-Buddy)
3. [WinZip System Tools](#Winzip-System-Tools)

### Bit Driver Updater
Basic Driver updater PUA, requires a key to even update drivers
### Bonzi Buddy
The purple monkey guy that steals your information
### WinZip System Tools
Borderline rogue, very irritating and requires key to achieve anything
